#  IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION PROJECT-

## Dataset Overview:

The Iris flower dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, originally published in the paper: The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems
It’s also called Anderson’s Iris dataset, as it was collected by Edgar Anderson to study the morphological variation in Iris flowers of three species:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica
Each flower sample includes the following four features (in cm):
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
Each of the three species contains 50 samples, making a total of 150 rows.

## Objective:

To train and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of the three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and is perfect for learning how to apply algorithms such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Results:

All models performed well, but Random Forest and SVM achieved the highest accuracy. The dataset’s linear separability made classification highly effective even with simpler models.
Visualizations such as pair plots, heatmaps and PCA-based scatter plots were used to explore the relationships between features and evaluate the model predictions.
